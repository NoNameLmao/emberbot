# emberbot

Rust version of emberbot, written using Serenity.

## Clone & build

Make sure you have Rust installed, if you don't - [install it](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoNameLmao/emberbot
cd ./emberbot
cargo build --release
```

## Run

> Create a `.env` file inside the bot directory, then write the following line in it:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord bot token here>`

Do not forget to replace `<discord token bot here>` with your discord bot's token

> After that's done, run the executable through your terminal/command prompt:

Windows: `.\target\release\emberbot.exe`

Linux: `./target/release/emberbot`

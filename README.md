# emberbot

Yet another completely useless but open source discord bot.

First created on 2nd of June 2021 in JavaScript,
then recoded in TypeScript in October 2021,
then recoded again but in Rust on 30th of July 2022.

## Clone & build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoNameLmao/emberbot
cd ./emberbot
cargo build --release
```

## Run

> Create a `.env` file inside the bot directory, then write the following line in it:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord bot token here>`

Do not forget to replace `<discord token bot here>` with your discord bot's token

> After that's done, run the executable through your terminal/command prompt:

Windows: `.\target\release\emberbot.exe`

Linux: `./target/release/emberbot`
